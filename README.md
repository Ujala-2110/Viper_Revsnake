# VIPER, Its Snake, but you're the food here. 

The source code is present inside `sketch/`.
## Main concept: 
 - The snake uses a shortest path algorithm (BFS for now) to get the minimum distance(avoiding obstacles) to the food and follows it aggressively.
### Run: 
 - run `npm install` to install the required libraries first
 - run `npm start` to begin serving `index.html` at `localhost`
 
 :)

 ## Instructions:
  - Use W,A,S,D to steer the food in the 2D spaces, avoiding the blocked cells
  - Control the speed of the snake using the slider, more speed == better score
  - That is pretty much it, Have fun :)


## All about
    In this game where the player controls the food, the goal is for the player to move the food around the game board while avoiding colliding with the snake that moves on its own. The game ends if the snake catches the food.

    The player can control the food's movement direction using keyboard inputs. However the snake moves independently and tries to follow the food in shortest path possible to consume it. We can control the speed of the snake. As the game progresses the player needs to be more agile in moving the food to avoid collision.

    The game can have multiple levels of difficulty, with increasing speed and complexity of obstacles. The reverse snake game with player-controlled food offers a unique twist on the classic snake game and can be enjoyed by players of all ages.
